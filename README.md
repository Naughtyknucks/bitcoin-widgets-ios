See status of your [full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node) and/or [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) Bitcoin explorer on your iPhone or iPad.

## Installation

Look for Bitcoin Widgets in Apple AppStore. Manual installation via Xcode is also possible.

## Configuration

Provide host and port of your full node in widget configuration.

* Public nodes are contacted directly via [Bitcoin protocol](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation).
* Nodes running as Tor hidden services are contacted via [Bitnodes API](https://bitnodes.io/api/).

If your node runs behind NAT, consider setting up a [reverse SSH tunnel](https://github.com/yanascz/bitcoind-tunnel).
